# Overview

## Folder structure

- _Generated - Creatures
- Backed - Ma
- Scripts

### _Generated - Creatures

This is the generated content

### Backed - Ma

This is still the generated result. But the generation process is not fully controlable as other named generated folders. The content will be imported as unitypackage made in yet another project.

### Scripts

The goal is to remove this folder entirely for the later development. Code specific to this satellite project should be in local package form. Code belongs to the unified project should be also in package form, but fetched remotely.
